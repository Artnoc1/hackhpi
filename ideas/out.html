But a close examination of regulatory reviews, court records and security filings by The New York Times leaves little doubt that Mr. Trump&#x2019;s casino business was a protracted failure. Though he now says his casinos were overtaken by the same tidal wave that eventually slammed this seaside city&#x2019;s gambling industry, in reality he was failing in Atlantic City long before Atlantic City itself was failing.</span></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="369" data-total-count="2555"><span style="color:red">But even as his companies did poorly, Mr. Trump did well.

The younger Mr. Trump made the payment, but the Casino Control Commission fined the Castle $65,000 for what had amounted to an illegal loan.</span></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="512" data-total-count="11547"><span style="color:red">As all of his ventures neared collapse, Mr. Trump&#x2019;s lenders insisted that he submit a business plan, appoint a chief financial officer for the Trump Organization and sell, among other things, the Trump Shuttle airline, his yacht and his stake in New York City&#x2019;s Plaza Hotel, which also filed for bankruptcy protection.

In the plan that was worked out, Mr. Trump ceded to the lenders a 50 percent stake in the businesses in return for lower interest rates. The lenders agreed to defer certain principal and interest payments and hold off on personal claims against Mr. Trump for five years.

During his financial pinch two years earlier, Chemical Bank had forced Mr. Trump to give up his ownership of the Trump Regency, a hotel next to the Trump Plaza. He held an option to buy it back for $60 million, which included debt on the hotel and $35.9 million that he personally owed the bank from his purchase of a Manhattan property.
