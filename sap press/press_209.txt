November 9, 2015 by SAP News
The transformation of the economy and society that is being rapidly brought by digitization alters all ways of interactions between humans and machines. [UPDATE] Snippets of SAP exec interviews are available at https://katch.me/SAPSmallBiz. In the midst of the digital revolution small agile firms together with entrepreneurs hold the key to rethink structures and processes to create more jobs. Today, democratized technology decreases the barriers to create new businesses, reduces the necessary capital investment and allows smaller firms to compete with larger, more established companies.
