At SAP, we did not invent the digital economy, but we unquestionably understand where it’s going. Today, 74% of all worldwide business transactions touch an SAP system. Over the past few years, we’ve been accelerating our innovations in the cloud. Our portfolio for digital business has also expanded through the acquisition of best-in-class companies with solutions and services businesses need today. As a result, we are stronger – for our customers, partners, and ourselves. We are the leading end-to-end solution provider, helping our customers transform in the digital economy. Today, we embrace the opportunity to grow even stronger together by unifying our brands. Starting this year, we are bringing our acquired companies closer together by introducing a unified SAP brand that includes Ariba, Fieldglass, hybris, and SuccessFactors solutions and services. This alignment of our brand means that in the future our solutions will be known as SAP Ariba, SAP Fieldglass, SAP Hybris, and SAP SuccessFactors respectively.  We believe a unified SAP brand will offer clarity to our customers and ecosystem partners across all touch points. Our goal is to deliver a simpler, superior customer experience, with all the SAP brands going to market with a consistent, unified look and feel. Ultimately our aspiration is for everyone who interacts with SAP to experience one brand with products and services spanning an end-to-end portfolio for the digital economy. I am proud to deliver this news and hope you will join me in exploring the new unified SAP brand in 2016. Best regards, Maggie Chan Jones Chief Marketing Officer, SAP
